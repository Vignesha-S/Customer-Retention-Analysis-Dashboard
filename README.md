# Customer-Retention-Analysis-Dashboard
## Overview:
This project involves the creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze customer retention and churn for a telecom company. The dashboard visualizes key metrics such as Churn Rate, Monthly Charges, Tenure, and Churn by Contract Type, helping to identify the factors influencing customer behavior and retention.

## Key Features:
- Item 1 Dynamic Visuals: Interactive charts and graphs that allow users to explore data by different segments like contract type, payment method, and customer demographics.
- Item 2 Data Grouping: Data was grouped into meaningful categories for better analysis (e.g., Monthly Charges and Tenure).
- Item 3 Conditional Formatting: Applied red and green colors to represent high churn and low churn values for easy interpretation.
Tooltips: Enhanced user experience by adding detailed tooltips that provide additional insights when hovering over data points.
Metrics and Visuals:
Churn Rate by Monthly Charges: Analyzes churn in relation to the monthly charges for customers.
Churn Rate by Tenure: Provides insights into how customer tenure correlates with churn.
Churn by Contract Type: Visualizes churn rates across different types of contracts (e.g., Month-to-Month, One Year, Two Year).
Customer Retention: Focuses on the retention rates across different segments of customers.
Technologies Used:
Power BI: For creating and visualizing the dashboard.
DAX: For data modeling and creating measures to calculate churn rates and other key metrics.
Data Analysis: Involves cleaning, transforming, and visualizing customer data to derive insights.
Data:
The dataset used in this project is from a telecom customer churn dataset. It includes details like customer demographics, account information, monthly charges, and whether the customer has churned or not.
